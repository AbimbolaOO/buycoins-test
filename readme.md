# Coding Challenge

Using the GraphQL GitHub API [https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/), recreate your github profile page (the tab that lists your repositories).

## What you SHOULD include

- The responsive design of the website. Make your recreation as close to the real website as possible
- The profile picture and basic description of the account
- 20 repositories (maximum)

See an example of what the final result should look like [https://res.cloudinary.com/bitkoin/image/upload/v1605131940/frontend_dev_example.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/bitkoin/image/upload/v1605131940/frontend_dev_example.png)

## What you should NOT include

- Pagination/Search functionality - you should load the first 20 repositories only
- The other tabs (e.g. Overview, Projects, Packages)
- The graph showing year of activity for the repository

## Other requirements

- Do not use any CSS or JS framework
- Host your site somewhere (e.g. Netlify or Github Pages)
